# Project Documentation

## 1. What does the Single Responsibility Principle consist of? What's its purpose?

The Single Responsibility Principle consists in making sure each class should only have one job. This will allow the project to be split into smaller parts that are easier to manage, maintain and scale if necessary. This also makes finding bugs and refactoring easier tasks. 

## 2. What characteristics does a “good” or clean code have?

Good code should have the following characteristics:

- **Readability**: The code is easy to read and understand. With good naming conventions, consistent indentations and style. No dirty commented out code and no unnecessary space.
- **Elegant**: The code tries to solve the problem as smoothly and as optimized/efficiently as possible. 
- **Modularity**: Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Maintainability**: The code is easy to update and add upon.
- **Consistency**: The code has consistentcy on what design patterns and practices are used.

## 3. Detail how you would do everything that you have not completed.

1. **UI/UX Improvements**: I would like to give a better pass on the app's UI and make it look closer to the original Figma design. I used the built in iOS components to make the UI as similar as possible. Some interactions where ambiguous on the Figma design, so I took some liberties on functionality. Tint colors are unconsistent. I would like to better display the Poster images. I would like to have a second look at all of the app's animations.
2. **Improve Loading View Sizes**: I would like to better distribute loading views whenever any data on the app appears. Covering the whole screen with a Loading View when a new screen loads would solve this. 
3. **Unit Tests!!**: This would allow the project and the code to be more reliable.
4. **Improvements on the Movie Detail View**: I would like to use the Youtube SDK to display the video in-app. This would keep the user in the app. I would also like to implement a carousel to display multiple videos, since the API brought multiple youtube videos for some movies.
5. **Improvements on networking**: I noticed inconsistencies and incorrect loadings whenever I moved from a loading screen to another quickly. I would like to fix this and also implement a way to reload all views.
